## NativePlatformWidget
Show content specific for a platform

## Features
- Allows platform/device specific content to be rendered
- No need to detect the platform or device yourself
- Option for tablet specific content

## Usage
- Place content in the iOS and Android drop zones for any device type
- Where necessary, you can place content in iOS iPad and/or Android tablet drop zones

The widget will render only one drop zone at any time. The any device type drop zone will not be rendered on a tablet when the tablet specific drop zone is filled.

Snippets will be a great help here in many cases.
